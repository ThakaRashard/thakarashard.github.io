WORLD WAR II VENEREAL DISEASE PREVENTION & SCARE FILM "PICK UP" SYPHILLIS 53594 (PRINT 1) 
[watch](https://youtu.be/i3pJejToetE) Pick-up (TF 8-2060) is an official War Department training film from 1944 that informs World War II servicemen about the dangers of sexually transmitted infections and the need to protect themselves from contracting a possible STI, as well as what to do to treat it and what happens if you don’t treat the infection. The film focuses on the symptoms of gonorrhea and syphilis as it covers proper courses of treatment. The film opens with a shot of an Air Force base where a soldier, Corporal John Greene, runs out of a building to talk to a friend who is working on building a sidewalk. Later, getting ready to take his leave, Greene walks into a train station (02:30) and goes to the ticket desk to pick up his ticket. He meets a girl named Anne, and he checks her luggage for her at the left luggage desk. The two go to a club, where people dance (05:10); John and Anne sit at a table and chat over a few beers. They dance while the band plays, drinking and having a merry time. Greene sits at the bar while Anne goes to the women’s room (08:28), and he has an internal conversation about whether or not to sleep with her. They sit on a park bench at night (10:45), and Greene pressures Anne into kissing him. Later, Greene walks into his barracks to go to bed (13:08), where his friend advises him to take an antibiotic to treat any possible STI. A montage of shots shows the days going by as Greene cleans his rifle and trains with his unit. In the men’s bathroom of Greene’s barracks (15:35), Greene looks sick and tells his friend he has a “dose.” At the base’s dispensary, Greene finds out he has gonorrhea (17:15). The captain at the dispensary tells Greene that he’ll give him a dose to treat the infection, but that Greene’s furlough is off the table. The captain tells Greene he may have syphilis as well. The patients in the base’s hospital stand at attention for inspection by the doctor (20:34). The doctor notifies Greene that he doesn’t have syphilis. Greene walks into the captain’s office at the dispensary (21:47), and the captain talks to Greene and a few other men about the importance of protecting themselves. The captain shows the men a microscope with a slide of the gonorrhea virus (22:51) and the syphilis virus—Treponema pallidum—with its spirochetes shape (26:58). The captain uses a poster of the prostate and male reproductive organs to show the men how gonorrhea causes permanent damage (24:33). The film then shows a man presenting a sore on his penis caused by syphilis (27:45); the film also shows the infection spreading to the back in the form of lesions. A man talks to a syphilis patient who is starting to lose his mind (29:03). A man with syphilis walks down a city sidewalk using two canes to support his weakened state from having the infection (29:40). The film shows two newborns born with syphilis (30:21), then it shows a shot of two soldiers walking into a U.S. Army Prophylactic Station (31:22). Greene walks out of the Station Hospital Administration Building (32:30). He asks his captain for another furlough (33:24), but he is told that his unit will be moving out for combat. Greene talks to his mother on a payphone (34:05) to inform her he is heading for war. In the barracks, men pack their things (35:05). The soldiers march in uniform, with their gear, and board an ocean liner (35:50) to take them overseas to the fighting. The film closes with an aerial shot of transport ships at sea.

@usgs 
Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is an effective way to measure changes in land surface altitude. InSAR makes high-density measurements over large areas by using radar signals from Earth-orbiting satellites to measure changes in land-surface altitude at high degrees of measurement resolution and spatial detail (Galloway and others, 2000).

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is produced by reflecting radar signals off a target area and measuring the two-way travel time back to the satellite. The SAR interferometry technique uses two SAR images of the same area acquired at different times and "interferes" (differences) them, resulting in maps called interferograms that show ground-surface displacement (range change) between the two time periods.

# Aqua MODIS Level-3 Global Mapped Remote-Sensing Reflectance (RRS) Data, version 2022.0
### Description [LiNK](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/catalog/ob-cloud-modisa-l3m-rrs-2022.0)
MODIS (or Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is a key instrument aboard the Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites. Terra's orbit around the Earth is timed so that it passes from north to south across the equator in the morning, while Aqua passes south to north over the equator in the afternoon. Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS are viewing the entire Earth's surface every 1 to 2 days, acquiring data in 36 spectral bands, or groups of wavelengths (see MODIS Technical Specifications). These data will improve our understanding of global dynamics and processes occurring on the land, in the oceans, and in the lower atmosphere. MODIS is playing a vital role in the development of validated, global, interactive Earth system models able to predict global change accurately enough to assist policy makers in making sound decisions concerning the protection of our environment.

 BACKGROUND:
  NASA's 26-day unmanned Artemis I mission was a test of integrated systems to:
   - launch Orion atop the SLS rocket 
   - operate the spacecraft in a deep space environment
   - orbit the Moon in a distant retrograde orbit before returning to Earth
   - test Orion's heat shield at 30,000 km/hr (2760 deg. C), and 
   - recover the crew module after reentry, descent, and splashdown
 MAJOR EVENTS:
  Launched November 16 @ 06:47:44 UTC from pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center. 
  Relative timings below may or may not be be shifted slightly due to launch 
  being delayed 43 minutes.
  launch+00h 18m 09s - Orion deploys solar arrays in Earth orbit
        +00h 52m 56s - Perigee raise maneuver (22 second burn)
        +01h 29m 27s - Trans-lunar injection burn (18m burn)
        +01h 57m 36s - Orion/ICPS separation

### What is sulfur dioxide (SO2)?
Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is comprised of one atom of sulfur and two atoms of oxygen, and is a gas at ambient temperatures. It has a pungent, irritating odor. SO2 is a member of a family of chemicals comprised of sulfur and oxygen that are collectively known as sulfur oxides (SOX). - [ReadMore](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/sulfur-dioxide-and-health#:~:text=The%20level%20of%20SO2,in%20most%20of%20the%20country.)

# Artemis II Weather Criteria
[Link](https://www.nasa.gov/artemis-ii-weather-criteria/)

## Basic Weather Criteria for Roll to the Pad
Do not roll to launch pad if the lightning forecast is greater than 10% within 20 nautical miles of the launch area during rollout. [Lightning by mexico](https://cdn.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES18/GLM/FD/EXTENT3/20260180046_GOES18-GLM-FD-EXTENT3-10848x10848.jpg) @blackgirlscode @la-county-isd [South America + Atlantic Ocean](https://cdn.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES19/GLM/FD/EXTENT3/20260180046_GOES19-GLM-FD-EXTENT3-10848x10848.jpg)

**Do not roll to launch pad** if there is greater than a 5% chance of hail forecast in the launch area during rollout.

**Do not roll to launch pad** if sustained wind is forecast to be greater than 40 knots or peak wind greater than 45 knots.

**Do not roll to launch pad** if temperature is less than 40 degrees Fahrenheit or exceeds 95 degrees Fahrenheit at the launch area during rollout.

Basic Weather Launch Criteria at the Pad for Liftoff
Temperature
**Do not initiate tanking** if the 24-hour average temperature at both 132.5 feet and 257.5 feet is less than 41.4 degrees Fahrenheit.

**Do not launch** if the temperature at both 132.5 feet and 257.5 feet exceeds 94.5 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 consecutive minutes.

**Do not launch** if the temperature at both 132.5 feet and 257.5 feet drops below a defined temperature constraint for 30 consecutive minutes. The temperature constraints range from 38 degrees Fahrenheit to 49 degrees Fahrenheit, depending upon the wind and relative humidity. Higher wind and relative humidity result in a colder temperature constraint.

Wind
**Do not launch** if the peak liftoff winds exceed a range of 29 knots through 39 knots between 132.5 feet and 457.5 feet, respectively.

**Do not launch** through upper-level wind conditions that could lead to control problems for the launch vehicle.

</div>


Precipitation
Do not launch through precipitation.

Lightning
Do not initiate tanking of the core stage or interim cryogenic propulsion stage (ICPS) if the lightning forecast is greater than 20% within 5 nautical miles of the launch area during tanking.

**Do not launch** for 30 minutes after lightning is observed within 10 nautical miles of the flight path, unless specified conditions related to cloud distance and surface electrical fields can be met.

**Do not launch** if the flight path is within 10 nautical miles of the edge of a thunderstorm that is producing lightning until 30 minutes after the last lightning discharge is observed.

**Do not launch** if the flight path is within 10 nautical miles of an attached thunderstorm anvil cloud unless temperature, time since last lightning, and distance criteria can be met, and if within 3 nautical miles, maximum radar reflectivity criteria also are satisfied.

**Do not launch** if the flight path is within 10 nautical miles of a detached thunderstorm anvil cloud unless temperature, time since lightning and/or detachment, and distance criteria can be met, and if within 3 nautical miles, maximum radar reflectivity criteria also are satisfied.



# Solar Activity
**Do not launch** during severe or extreme solar activity resulting in increased density of solar energetic particles with the potential to damage electronic circuits and make radio communication with the launch vehicle difficult or impossible.

:Product: 3-Day Forecast
:Issued: 2026 Jan 18 0030 UTC
# Prepared by the U.S. Dept. of Commerce, NOAA, Space Weather Prediction Center
#
A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 18-Jan 20 2026 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jan 18-Jan 20 2026

             Jan 18       Jan 19       Jan 20
00-03UT       4.33         4.00         3.67     
03-06UT       4.67 (G1)    3.67         3.67     
06-09UT       4.00         3.33         3.33     
09-12UT       3.00         3.00         3.00     
12-15UT       3.00         3.00         2.00

21-00UT       3.67         4.00         3.33     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are expected on 18 Jan due to
influence from a positive polarity coronal hole.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 18-Jan 20 2026

              Jan 18  Jan 19  Jan 20
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jan 17 2026 1029 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 18-Jan 20 2026

              Jan 18        Jan 19        Jan 20
R1-R2           55%           55%           55%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely, with a
slight chance of R3 (Strong), over 18-20 Jan due to the flare potential
from multiple complex regions on the solar disk.

Clouds
**Do not launch** if the flight path is within 3 nautical miles of a thunderstorm debris cloud for 3 hours, unless temperature, surface electric field, and radar reflectivity criteria can be met.

**Do not launch** if the flight path is within 5 nautical miles of disturbed weather clouds that extend into freezing temperatures and contain moderate or greater precipitation.

**Do not launch** through a cloud layer that is within 5 nautical miles, greater than 4,500 feet thick, and extends into freezing temperatures, unless specific criteria related to radar reflectivity and cloud altitude can be met.

**Do not launch** if the flight path is within 10 nautical miles of cumulus clouds with certain distance and height criteria. There are additional caveats that could be met for clouds not reaching -5 degrees Celsius.

**Do not launch** through cumulus clouds formed as the result of or directly attached to a smoke plume, unless more than 60 minutes passed since detachment from the smoke plume.

**Do not launch** for 15 minutes if field mill instrument readings within 5 nautical miles of the launch pad equal or exceed +/- 1,500 volts per meter, or +/- 1,000 volts per meter, unless specific caveats related to clouds within 10 nautical miles of the flight path can be met.
