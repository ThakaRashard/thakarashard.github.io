# DefiningThug
Latrice, I hope you understand that your image of thuggery does not include striptease... I dont think these guys ever promoted that pasttime even if they have been. And All #BlackHeteromen have had at least one significant other kidnapped in thier life by the time they have a child in middle school... In other words, I know how some of the other girls critisized me about working. Erika was a huge critic! But from your perspective you go out and about in your Ohio Neighborhood and you are judign time spent outside and how pleasant your interactions are with their dependents so your definition might stick if you take me to meet them with your mom

Deaths Direct/Indirect	12/0 (fatality details below, when available...)
[link - MALIBU COAST](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=1230300)
Episode Narrative	The combination of very strong Santa Ana winds, mountain wave activity and critically dry vegetation resulted in a significant outbreak of wildfires across Los Angeles and Ventura counties. The Palisades Fire (23,707 acres) and the Eaton Fire (14,021 acres) combined to become the most significant natural disaster in U.S. history. Two smaller fires, the Hurst Fire (799 acres) and the Kenneth Fire (1,052 acres) also developed during this outbreak, but were not anywhere as damaging.
Event Narrative	The Palisades Fire burned 23,707 acres across the Santa Monica Mountains and the Malibu coastal strip. The wildfire ignited during an extreme fire weather event with PDS Red Flag Warnings in effect. The combination of wind gusts in excess of 80 MPH and critically dry vegetation allowed the fire to grow explosively. The fire completed destroyed the community of Pacific Palisades and part of the community of Malibu. Throughout the fire, 6,837 structures were destroyed and another 973 structures were damaged, including many residences. Twelve civilian deaths, three civilian injuries and one firefighter injury were reported.sni

gm latrice of Virtiserv @nasa-jpl @cityoflosangeles KarenBass I am going to visit Augustine by sea. I hope they have a bagel. Lafirstumc is closed today for `The Advent` @blackgirlscode I need protection, I heard [Ctrl](https://youtu.be/oUzIlVuGdtE?si=yvZ8JDQ_W8A5n0z4). it's about a girl healing her sex life with an rem cycle his wife did not have an interest in utilizing and I remember hardly anything @stateofcalifornia HollyMithell, Gavin Newsom @newshour I know y'all don't care like tht I have to ask normani if [Go Gina](https://m.soundcloud.com/szababy2/go-gina?in=bemox3x/sets/yuh) is her giving latrice permission to court me. There is anger but they both play NCAA team sports at points in their growth so @nasa-pds I'm trying to clear some things connected to my missing cassini work @blackgirlscode it was on the hot pepper and my Motorola that were pilfered @libretro

EXOMARS TRACE GAS ORBITER (TGO)
SEARCHING FOR SIGNATURE GASES IN THE MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE
The 2016 ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter is the first in a series of Mars missions to be undertaken jointly by the two space agencies, ESA and Roscosmos. A key goal of this mission is to gain a better understanding of methane and other atmospheric gases that are present in small concentrations (less than 1% of the atmosphere) but nevertheless could be evidence for possible biological or geological activity.

# Entomological warfare 

<a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fd1d90f-77e6-4b18-9651-8b0aea49c5d3"><img   alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fd1d90f-77e6-4b18-9651-8b0aea49c5d3" style="width: 25%; height: auto;"/></a>

[@Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomological_warfare)
EW is a specific type of [biological warfare](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7150198/) that uses insects in a direct attack or as vectors to deliver a biological agent, such as plague or cholera. Essentially, EW exists in three varieties.[2] One type of EW involves infecting insects with a pathogen and then dispersing the insects over target areas.[3] The insects then act as a vector, infecting any person or animal they might bite. Another type of EW is a direct insect attack against crops; the insect may not be infected with any pathogen but instead represents a threat to agriculture.[3] The final method of entomological warfare is to use uninfected insects, such as bees, to directly attack the enemy. Any organism that makes use of toxins—from bacteria to snakes—is engaging in a form of biological warfare. Humans who engage in biological warfare do so by taking advantage of these toxin-producing organisms. - [@NIH .gov Biological Warfare: Infectious Disease and Bioterrorism](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7150198/) Man has used poisons for assassination purposes ever since the dawn of civilization, not only against individual enemies but also occasionally against armies (Table 1). However, the foundation of microbiology by Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch offered new prospects for those interested in biological weapons because it allowed agents to be chosen and designed on a rational basis. -[nih.gov PMID: 12789407: The history of biological warfare Friedrich Frischknecht ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1326439/) [National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center Location: Fort Detrick, MD](https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/national-biodefense-analysis-and-countermeasures-center) [Disinformation and Epidemics: Anticipating the Next Phase of Biowarfare Rose Bernard](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9195489/) [Biowarfare, bioterrorism and biocrime: A historical overview on microbial harmful applications](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7305902/) [Giving Full Measure to Countermeasures](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK215966/): Addressing Problems in the DoD Program to Develop Medical Countermeasures Against Biological Warfare Agents. [REad on nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK215957/#ddd00029) Biological weapons may be employed in various ways to gain a strategic or tactical advantage over the enemy, either by threats or by actual deployments. Like some chemical weapons, biological weapons may also be useful as area denial weapons. [Wiki @blackgirlscode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_warfare)

**Do not launch**  if the sustained wind
at the 162-foot level of the launch
pad exceeds 30 mph.

**Do not launch**  through upper-level
conditions containing wind shear
that could lead to control problems
for the launch vehicle.

**Do not launch**  for 30 minutes
after lightning is observed within
10 nautical miles of the launch pad
or the flight path, unless specified
conditions can be met.

**Do not launch**  within 10 nautical
miles of an attached thunderstorm
anvil cloud, unless temperature and
time-associated distance criteria can
be met.

**Do not launch**  within 10 nautical
miles of a detached thunderstorm
anvil cloud.

**Do not launch**  within 3 nautical
miles of a thunderstorm debris
cloud, unless specific timeassociated distance criteria can
be met.

**Do not launch**  within 5 nautical
miles of disturbed weather
clouds that extend into freezing
temperatures and contain moderate
or greater precipitation, unless
specific time-associated distance
criteria can be met.

**Do not launch**  for 15 minutes if
field mill instrument readings within
five nautical miles of the launch pad
exceed +/- 1,500 volts per meter, or
+/- 1,000 volts per meter if specified
criteria can be met.

**Do not launch**  through a cloud
layer greater than 4,500 feet
thick that extends into freezing
temperatures, unless other specific
criteria can be met.

**Do not launch**  within 10 nautical
miles of cumulus clouds with
tops that extend into freezing
temperatures, unless specific
height-associated distance criteria
can be met.

**Do not launch**  within 10 nautical
miles of the edge of a thunderstorm
that is producing lightning within
30 minutes after the last lightning is
observed.

**Do not launch**  through cumulus
clouds formed as the result of or
directly attached to a smoke plume,
unless time-associated criteria can
be met.

**Do not launch**  if downrange
weather indicates violation of limits
at splashdown in case of Dragon
launch escape.

**Do not launch**  if downrange
weather shows high probability of
violating limits at splashdown in
case of Dragon launch escape.
Downrange weather is monitored
at more than 50 locations along
the ascent track along the North
American eastern seaboard and
across the North Atlantic.
Probability of violation is calculated
for each location including limit
conditions for wind, waves, lightning,
and precipitation

New Glenn had targeted a 2:50 p.m. EST (1850 GMT) liftoff from Blue Origin's Space Launch Complex-36, at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station today (Nov. 12), to send NASA's twin ESCAPADE orbiters to Mars. "However, due to highly [elevated solar activity](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/dscovr/plots/dscovr_6hr_plots/2025/11/2025111106-6hr.png) and its potential effects on the ESCAPADE spacecraft, NASA is postponing launch until space weather conditions improve," Blue Origin wrote in a post on X.)

The Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) mission to Mars, led by the University of California, Berkeley’s Space Sciences Laboratory, is set to launch sometime in fall 2024. It consists of two identical smallsats, named Blue and Gold, that will study Mars’ magnetosphere and its interaction with the solar wind. While the exact launch date is still to be determined, if the launch is successful, then ESCAPADE is projected to reach Mars by September 2025.

Assuming that the MRO Primary Science Mission extends for 2 Earth years and is supported by
two nominally 8 hour X Band 34 m DSN passes per day and three 70m passes per week, the
spacecraft is capable of returning a total of up to 34 terabits (Tbits) of data, transmitting at rates
which vary throughout the mission from 20 to 100 and back to 20 gigabits (Gbits) of data per
day. The lowest data rates occur at the start of the Primary Science Mission when the EarthMars range is greatest, and the highest data rates occur when the range is small, a period
extending from late October 2007 to June 2008. Table 2 shows telemetry data volumes allocated
to each instrument, based on full mission success criteria of 26 Tb data downlinked for all
instruments combined. It is expected that 34.5 Tb as opposed to 26 Tb of data will be
downlinked. Additional data may be transmitted using X Band 70 m DSN coverage, particularly
early in the mission when data rates are otherwise low. MRO also carries a Ka Band
demonstration package, which can be used on additional DSN passes to augment the nominal
science data return. Additional data would also be acquired during any extended missions. Table
3 shows estimated science product volumes for several data return cases.
The generation of EDRs and RDRs from telemetry data typically results in a data volume
expansion of at least an order of magnitude. Thus, archiving MRO data will be challenging
indeed since at least several hundred terabits of data will be produ

## [Here’s who has been impacted by the AWS outage ](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5564082-aws-outage-lyft-fortnite-coinbase-peloton-roblox-amazon/)

Here's the timeline [Tom's Hardwaretomshw.it/](https://www.tomshw.it/) [git](https://github.com/tomshw)
At around 12:11am PDT (3:11am ET, 8:11am BST), AWS started experiencing outages. And as AWS is the backbone of most of the internet, it took out hundreds of websites and services with it.
We started seeing huge spikes in outage reports for apps like Snapchat, Venmo and Ring, Amazon services like Alexa, and games like Fornite and Pokémon GO.
At 1:26am PDT (4:26am ET, 9:26am BST), the issue was diagnosed as a big one related to the DynamoDB endpoint of AWS — the digital phonebook of the internet.
At 2:01am PDT (5:01am ET, 10:01am BST), the specific problem was identified and work on a fix began.
At 2:22am PDT (5:22am ET, 10:22am BST), the fix was deployed and since then, service has been slowly but surely returning to normal.
BUT THEN, Reddit went down, and AWS updated saying there is a backlog of issues to work through.
At 4:48am PDT (7:48am ET, 12:48pm BST), Amazon has found a fix but is still working on issues, as Ring and Chime are experiencing outages.
At 5:48am PDT (8:48 ET, 1:48pm BST), more fixes are being applied. But almost in an interesting game of whack-a-mole, Wordle is down, and Snapchat users are experiencing outages too. The AWS outage reports are slowly starting to creep up again.
At 9:15am PDT (11:15 am ET, 4:15pm BST) we started seeing a huge spike in reports for Venmo, a popular payment app. This came shortly after AWS said it was still investigating the root cause and identifying mitigations. It's still an issue and most definitely not resolved yet.
At 10:03am PDT 1:03 pm ET, 6:15pm BST) AWS posted some updates, but it didn't add much other than letting us know it's working on the problem. At 10:38 PDT, the compay said, "We are applying mitigations to the remaining AZs at which point we expect launch errors and network connectivity issues to subside."
At 12:15 p.m. PDT (3:15 ET, 8;15 BST) AWS posted some updates that the claimed services were starting to return with some intermittent function errors. We've also seen a slow but steady decrease in reports on Down Detector.
Between 1:00 pm PDT and 2:30 pm, AWS posted cautious updates about slowly reducing throttles as the company brought more features back online.
At 3:00 pm PDT (6 ET, 11 BST) AWS closed the issue listing as resolved and blaming it on a DNS issue and nin internal subsystem that didn't resolve after a DNS fix.

Horizons> DSCOVR
*******************************************************************************
 Revised: Sep 03, 2025          DSCOVR Spacecraft  / (Earth)                -78 
                             http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/DSCOVR/
 BACKGROUND:
  DSCOVR was launched Feb 11, 2015 @ 23:03:02 UTC from Cape Canaveral, Florida, 
  USA using a Space-X Falcon 9 v1.1
  DSCOVR was placed in a six-month Lissajous orbit around Sun-Earth Lagrange 
  Point 1 (L1) on June 8, 2015, about 200 Earth radii upstream of Earth in the
  direction of the Sun.
  Main instrument are:
   (1) Sun-observing Plasma Magnetometer (PlasMag)
   (2) Earth-observing NIST Advanced Radiometer (NISTAR) 
   (3) Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) 
   (4) Electron Spectrometer (ES)   
   (5) Pulse Height Analyzer (PHA)
  Objectives of the DSCOVR 5-year mission:
   * Observe unperturbed solar wind 15-60 minutes prior to it impacting
      the Earth's magnetosphere (geomagnetic storm warnings).
   * Provide early warnings of coronal mass ejections
   * Observe changes in Earth atmosphere ozone, aerosols, dust, nand cloud
      height at two hour intervals.
  DSCOVR (formerly known as Triana) was originally conceived in the late 1990s
  as a NASA Earth science mission. The mission was canceled and the satellite 
  was put into storage in 2001. NOAA and the USAF had DSCOVR removed from 
  storage in 2008 and subsequently funded NASA to test and refurbish the
  spacecraft and sensors.
  @NOAA operates #DSCOVR from its Satellite Operations Facility in Suitland, 
  #Maryland and distributes the data to users and partner agencies. NOAA will 
  process the space weather data, providing products and forecasts through 
  the NOAA #SpaceWeather Prediction Center in #BoulderColorado, and archive 
  the data at the NOAA National Geophysical Data Center in Boulder, Colorado. 
  NASA is responsible for processing the Earth sensor data.
 SPACECRAFT PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS:
  Mass      :  570 kg at launch
 SPACECRAFT TRAJECTORY: 
EPIC?
EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) is a 10-channel spectroradiometer (317 – 780 nm) onboard NOAA’s DSCOVR (Deep Space Climate Observatory) spacecraft. EPIC provides 10 narrow band spectral images of the entire sunlit face of Earth using a 2048x2048 pixel CCD (Charge Coupled Device) detector coupled to a 30-cm aperture Cassegrain telescope (Figure 1).
