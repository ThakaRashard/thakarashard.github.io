### What is sulfur dioxide (SO2)?
Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is comprised of one atom of sulfur and two atoms of oxygen, and is a gas at ambient temperatures. It has a pungent, irritating odor. SO2 is a member of a family of chemicals comprised of sulfur and oxygen that are collectively known as sulfur oxides (SOX). - [ReadMore](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/sulfur-dioxide-and-health#:~:text=The%20level%20of%20SO2,in%20most%20of%20the%20country.)

# Artemis II Weather Criteria
[Link](https://www.nasa.gov/artemis-ii-weather-criteria/)

## Basic Weather Criteria for Roll to the Pad
Do not roll to launch pad if the lightning forecast is greater than 10% within 20 nautical miles of the launch area during rollout. [Lightning by mexico](https://cdn.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES18/GLM/FD/EXTENT3/20260180046_GOES18-GLM-FD-EXTENT3-10848x10848.jpg) @blackgirlscode @la-county-isd [South America + Atlantic Ocean](https://cdn.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES19/GLM/FD/EXTENT3/20260180046_GOES19-GLM-FD-EXTENT3-10848x10848.jpg)

**Do not roll to launch pad** if there is greater than a 5% chance of hail forecast in the launch area during rollout.

**Do not roll to launch pad** if sustained wind is forecast to be greater than 40 knots or peak wind greater than 45 knots.

**Do not roll to launch pad** if temperature is less than 40 degrees Fahrenheit or exceeds 95 degrees Fahrenheit at the launch area during rollout.

Basic Weather Launch Criteria at the Pad for Liftoff
Temperature
**Do not initiate tanking** if the 24-hour average temperature at both 132.5 feet and 257.5 feet is less than 41.4 degrees Fahrenheit.

**Do not launch** if the temperature at both 132.5 feet and 257.5 feet exceeds 94.5 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 consecutive minutes.

**Do not launch** if the temperature at both 132.5 feet and 257.5 feet drops below a defined temperature constraint for 30 consecutive minutes. The temperature constraints range from 38 degrees Fahrenheit to 49 degrees Fahrenheit, depending upon the wind and relative humidity. Higher wind and relative humidity result in a colder temperature constraint.

Wind
**Do not launch** if the peak liftoff winds exceed a range of 29 knots through 39 knots between 132.5 feet and 457.5 feet, respectively.

**Do not launch** through upper-level wind conditions that could lead to control problems for the launch vehicle.

</div>


Precipitation
Do not launch through precipitation.

Lightning
Do not initiate tanking of the core stage or interim cryogenic propulsion stage (ICPS) if the lightning forecast is greater than 20% within 5 nautical miles of the launch area during tanking.

**Do not launch** for 30 minutes after lightning is observed within 10 nautical miles of the flight path, unless specified conditions related to cloud distance and surface electrical fields can be met.

**Do not launch** if the flight path is within 10 nautical miles of the edge of a thunderstorm that is producing lightning until 30 minutes after the last lightning discharge is observed.

**Do not launch** if the flight path is within 10 nautical miles of an attached thunderstorm anvil cloud unless temperature, time since last lightning, and distance criteria can be met, and if within 3 nautical miles, maximum radar reflectivity criteria also are satisfied.

**Do not launch** if the flight path is within 10 nautical miles of a detached thunderstorm anvil cloud unless temperature, time since lightning and/or detachment, and distance criteria can be met, and if within 3 nautical miles, maximum radar reflectivity criteria also are satisfied.



# Solar Activity
**Do not launch** during severe or extreme solar activity resulting in increased density of solar energetic particles with the potential to damage electronic circuits and make radio communication with the launch vehicle difficult or impossible.

:Product: 3-Day Forecast
:Issued: 2026 Jan 18 0030 UTC
# Prepared by the U.S. Dept. of Commerce, NOAA, Space Weather Prediction Center
#
A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 18-Jan 20 2026 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jan 18-Jan 20 2026

             Jan 18       Jan 19       Jan 20
00-03UT       4.33         4.00         3.67     
03-06UT       4.67 (G1)    3.67         3.67     
06-09UT       4.00         3.33         3.33     
09-12UT       3.00         3.00         3.00     
12-15UT       3.00         3.00         2.00

21-00UT       3.67         4.00         3.33     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are expected on 18 Jan due to
influence from a positive polarity coronal hole.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 18-Jan 20 2026

              Jan 18  Jan 19  Jan 20
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jan 17 2026 1029 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 18-Jan 20 2026

              Jan 18        Jan 19        Jan 20
R1-R2           55%           55%           55%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely, with a
slight chance of R3 (Strong), over 18-20 Jan due to the flare potential
from multiple complex regions on the solar disk.

Clouds
**Do not launch** if the flight path is within 3 nautical miles of a thunderstorm debris cloud for 3 hours, unless temperature, surface electric field, and radar reflectivity criteria can be met.

**Do not launch** if the flight path is within 5 nautical miles of disturbed weather clouds that extend into freezing temperatures and contain moderate or greater precipitation.

**Do not launch** through a cloud layer that is within 5 nautical miles, greater than 4,500 feet thick, and extends into freezing temperatures, unless specific criteria related to radar reflectivity and cloud altitude can be met.

**Do not launch** if the flight path is within 10 nautical miles of cumulus clouds with certain distance and height criteria. There are additional caveats that could be met for clouds not reaching -5 degrees Celsius.

**Do not launch** through cumulus clouds formed as the result of or directly attached to a smoke plume, unless more than 60 minutes passed since detachment from the smoke plume.

**Do not launch** for 15 minutes if field mill instrument readings within 5 nautical miles of the launch pad equal or exceed +/- 1,500 volts per meter, or +/- 1,000 volts per meter, unless specific caveats related to clouds within 10 nautical miles of the flight path can be met.

Launch Weather Criteria
Do not launch if the sustained wind 
at the 162-foot level of the launch 
pad exceeds 30 mph.
Do not launch through upper-level 
conditions containing wind shear 
that could lead to control problems 
for the launch vehicle.
Do not launch for 30 minutes 
after lightning is observed within 
10 nautical miles of the launch pad 
or the flight path, unless specified 
conditions can be met.
Do not launch within 10 nautical 
miles of an attached thunderstorm 
anvil cloud, unless temperature and 
time-associated distance criteria can 
be met.
Do not launch within 10 nautical 
miles of a detached thunderstorm 
anvil cloud.
Do not launch within 3 nautical 
miles of a thunderstorm debris 
cloud, unless specific time-
associated distance criteria can 
be met.
Do not launch within 5 nautical 
miles of disturbed weather 
clouds that extend into freezing 
temperatures and contain moderate 
or greater precipitation, unless 
specific time-associated distance 
criteria can be met.
Do not launch for 15 minutes if 
field mill instrument readings within 
five nautical miles of the launch pad 
exceed +/- 1,500 volts per meter, or 
+/- 1,000 volts per meter if specified 
criteria can be met.
Do not launch through a cloud 
layer greater than 4,500 feet 
thick that extends into freezing 
temperatures, unless other specific 
criteria can be met.
Do not launch within 10 nautical 
miles of cumulus clouds with 
tops that extend into freezing 
temperatures, unless specific 
height-associated distance criteria 
can be met.
Do not launch within 10 nautical 
miles of the edge of a thunderstorm 
that is producing lightning within 
30 minutes after the last lightning is 
observed.
Do not launch through cumulus 
clouds formed as the result of or 
directly attached to a smoke plume, 
unless time-associated criteria can 
be met.
Do not launch if downrange 
weather indicates violation of limits 
at splashdown in case of Dragon 
launch escape.
Do not launch if downrange 
weather shows high probability of 
violating limits at splashdown in 
case of Dragon launch escape. 
Downrange weather is monitored 
at more than 50 locations along 
the ascent track along the North 
American eastern seaboard and 
across the North Atlantic.
Probability of violation is calculated 
for each location including limit 
conditions for wind, waves, lightning, 

and precipitation.

# DefiningThug
Latrice, I hope you understand that your image of thuggery does not include striptease... I dont think these guys ever promoted that pasttime even if they have been. And All #BlackHeteromen have had at least one significant other kidnapped in thier life by the time they have a child in middle school... In other words, I know how some of the other girls critisized me about working. Erika was a huge critic! But from your perspective you go out and about in your Ohio Neighborhood and you are judign time spent outside and how pleasant your interactions are with their dependents so your definition might stick if you take me to meet them with your mom

Deaths Direct/Indirect	12/0 (fatality details below, when available...)
[link - MALIBU COAST](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=1230300)
Episode Narrative	The combination of very strong Santa Ana winds, mountain wave activity and critically dry vegetation resulted in a significant outbreak of wildfires across Los Angeles and Ventura counties. The Palisades Fire (23,707 acres) and the Eaton Fire (14,021 acres) combined to become the most significant natural disaster in U.S. history. Two smaller fires, the Hurst Fire (799 acres) and the Kenneth Fire (1,052 acres) also developed during this outbreak, but were not anywhere as damaging.
Event Narrative	The Palisades Fire burned 23,707 acres across the Santa Monica Mountains and the Malibu coastal strip. The wildfire ignited during an extreme fire weather event with PDS Red Flag Warnings in effect. The combination of wind gusts in excess of 80 MPH and critically dry vegetation allowed the fire to grow explosively. The fire completed destroyed the community of Pacific Palisades and part of the community of Malibu. Throughout the fire, 6,837 structures were destroyed and another 973 structures were damaged, including many residences. Twelve civilian deaths, three civilian injuries and one firefighter injury were reported.sni
