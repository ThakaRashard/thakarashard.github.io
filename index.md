[Ground & Flight Data Systems Group](https://www.nasa.gov/intelligent-systems-division/collaborative-and-assistant-systems/ground-and-flight-data-systems-group/)  creates systems to facilitate transmission and processing of data between spacecraft, rovers, satellites, ground control, and distributed mission teams. Data ranges from communications, telemetry, and Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) data, to planetary, astrophysical, medical, and biological science research data and analytics. Ground processing of data is accomplished by science pipeline data systems, which transform raw, uncorrected, uncalibrated data into usable products for the science community. GFDS designs systems to satisfy carefully defined and documented user requirements involving the secure handling of sensitive and irreplaceable mission data. The group supports space and planetary exploration missions, as well as Earth and space sciences, small satellite, and aeronautics missions and projects.

The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) [1, 2] has a suite of instruments
making observations at Mars, and it provides data-relay services for Mars
landers and rovers. MRO was launched on August 12, 2005. The orbiter
successfully went into orbit around Mars on March 10, 2006 and began
reducing its orbit altitude and circularizing the orbit in preparation for the
science mission. The orbit changing was accomplished through a process called aerobraking, in preparation for the “science mission” starting in November
2006, followed by the “relay mission” starting in November 2008. MRO
participated in the Mars Science Laboratory touchdown and surface mission
that began in August 2012 (Chapter 7).

The establishment of the USSF resulted from widespread recognition that space is a national security imperative. When combined with the growing threat posed by strategic competitors in space, it became clear that there was a need for a military service focused solely on pursuing superiority in the space domain.

WORLD WAR II VENEREAL DISEASE PREVENTION & SCARE FILM "PICK UP" SYPHILLIS 53594 (PRINT 1) 
[watch](https://youtu.be/i3pJejToetE) Pick-up (TF 8-2060) is an official War Department training film from 1944 that informs World War II servicemen about the dangers of sexually transmitted infections and the need to protect themselves from contracting a possible STI, as well as what to do to treat it and what happens if you don’t treat the infection. The film focuses on the symptoms of gonorrhea and syphilis as it covers proper courses of treatment. The film opens with a shot of an Air Force base where a soldier, Corporal John Greene, runs out of a building to talk to a friend who is working on building a sidewalk. Later, getting ready to take his leave, Greene walks into a train station (02:30) and goes to the ticket desk to pick up his ticket. He meets a girl named Anne, and he checks her luggage for her at the left luggage desk. The two go to a club, where people dance (05:10); John and Anne sit at a table and chat over a few beers. They dance while the band plays, drinking and having a merry time. Greene sits at the bar while Anne goes to the women’s room (08:28), and he has an internal conversation about whether or not to sleep with her. They sit on a park bench at night (10:45), and Greene pressures Anne into kissing him. Later, Greene walks into his barracks to go to bed (13:08), where his friend advises him to take an antibiotic to treat any possible STI. A montage of shots shows the days going by as Greene cleans his rifle and trains with his unit. In the men’s bathroom of Greene’s barracks (15:35), Greene looks sick and tells his friend he has a “dose.” At the base’s dispensary, Greene finds out he has gonorrhea (17:15). The captain at the dispensary tells Greene that he’ll give him a dose to treat the infection, but that Greene’s furlough is off the table. The captain tells Greene he may have syphilis as well. The patients in the base’s hospital stand at attention for inspection by the doctor (20:34). The doctor notifies Greene that he doesn’t have syphilis. Greene walks into the captain’s office at the dispensary (21:47), and the captain talks to Greene and a few other men about the importance of protecting themselves. The captain shows the men a microscope with a slide of the gonorrhea virus (22:51) and the syphilis virus—Treponema pallidum—with its spirochetes shape (26:58). The captain uses a poster of the prostate and male reproductive organs to show the men how gonorrhea causes permanent damage (24:33). The film then shows a man presenting a sore on his penis caused by syphilis (27:45); the film also shows the infection spreading to the back in the form of lesions. A man talks to a syphilis patient who is starting to lose his mind (29:03). A man with syphilis walks down a city sidewalk using two canes to support his weakened state from having the infection (29:40). The film shows two newborns born with syphilis (30:21), then it shows a shot of two soldiers walking into a U.S. Army Prophylactic Station (31:22). Greene walks out of the Station Hospital Administration Building (32:30). He asks his captain for another furlough (33:24), but he is told that his unit will be moving out for combat. Greene talks to his mother on a payphone (34:05) to inform her he is heading for war. In the barracks, men pack their things (35:05). The soldiers march in uniform, with their gear, and board an ocean liner (35:50) to take them overseas to the fighting. The film closes with an aerial shot of transport ships at sea.

@usgs 
Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is an effective way to measure changes in land surface altitude. InSAR makes high-density measurements over large areas by using radar signals from Earth-orbiting satellites to measure changes in land-surface altitude at high degrees of measurement resolution and spatial detail (Galloway and others, 2000).

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is produced by reflecting radar signals off a target area and measuring the two-way travel time back to the satellite. The SAR interferometry technique uses two SAR images of the same area acquired at different times and "interferes" (differences) them, resulting in maps called interferograms that show ground-surface displacement (range change) between the two time periods.

# Aqua MODIS Level-3 Global Mapped Remote-Sensing Reflectance (RRS) Data, version 2022.0
### Description [LiNK](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/catalog/ob-cloud-modisa-l3m-rrs-2022.0)
MODIS (or Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is a key instrument aboard the Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites. Terra's orbit around the Earth is timed so that it passes from north to south across the equator in the morning, while Aqua passes south to north over the equator in the afternoon. Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS are viewing the entire Earth's surface every 1 to 2 days, acquiring data in 36 spectral bands, or groups of wavelengths (see MODIS Technical Specifications). These data will improve our understanding of global dynamics and processes occurring on the land, in the oceans, and in the lower atmosphere. MODIS is playing a vital role in the development of validated, global, interactive Earth system models able to predict global change accurately enough to assist policy makers in making sound decisions concerning the protection of our environment.
