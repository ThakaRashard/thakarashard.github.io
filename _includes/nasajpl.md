![Juno Fly By](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpegMod/PIA22942_modest.jpg)
This image of Jupiter's turbulent southern hemisphere was captured by NASA's Juno spacecraft as it performed its most recent close flyby of the gas giant planet on Dec. 21, 2018.

This new perspective captures the notable Great Red Spot, as well as a massive storm called Oval BA. The storm reached its current size when three smaller spots collided and merged in the year 2000. The Great Red Spot, which is about twice as wide as Oval BA, may have formed from the same process centuries ago.

In this clip, Don "Magic" Juan talked about why prostitution will always be around and the reasons he believes a prostitute needs a pimp. He also spoke on his transition from pimping into a spiritual advisory role and how he uses his social media as a way to provide that for his followers. Bishop Don "Magic" Juan closed out by talking about maintaining his health, smoking weed since 12, and how he stayed away from all the other drugs. - [VLAD](https://www.youtube.com/@vladtv)

>NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance mission captured thrilling footage of its rover landing in Mars' Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021. The real footage in this video was captured by several cameras that are part of the rover's entry, descent, and landing suite. The views include a camera looking down from the spacecraft's descent stage (a kind of rocket-powered jet pack that helps fly the rover to its landing site), a camera on the rover looking up at the descent stage, a camera on the top of the aeroshell (a capsule protecting the rover) looking up at that parachute, and a camera on the bottom of the rover looking down at the Martian surface.
