MODIS (or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is a key instrument aboard the Terra (originally known as EOS AM-1) and Aqua (originally known as EOS PM-1) satellites. Terra's orbit around the Earth is timed so that it passes from north to south across the equator in the morning, while Aqua passes south to north over the equator in the afternoon.

### AIRSAR Operations Overview
  
Functionally, a typical AIRSAR operations can be divided into four main parts: (1) mission planning, (2) instrument maintenance and upgrades, (3) mission and flight operations, and (4) data processing and distribution. In reality, mission planning for the next year (and to some extent flight operations for the next year) takes place at the same time as data processing and distribution for the previous flight season. In this chapter a general discussion of AIRSAR operations is given.
 
2-1 Flight Request/Approval

AIRSAR flights are performed in response to flight requests submitted by the Principal Investigators (PIs) of NASA-sponsored scientific investigations and by sponsors from other organizations who contract to acquire AIRSAR data on a reimbursable basis. Appendix X contains a blank flight request, copies of which are available from the Aircraft Programs office at Ames Research Center in Mountain View, CA. A completed sample flight request is shown in Figure 2.X. Upon completion, flight requests should be sent to Ames Research Center and the relevant Program Manager at NASA Headquarters. Each year, usually in June, the cognizant NASA Headquarters Program Office reviews flight requests. Once NASA approves flight requests, Ames Research Center creates a mission schedule. Flight requests are typically due at Ames Research Center at the end of June each year, but a longer lead time may be necessary when a mission involves basing the DC-8 away from Moffett Field for extended periods.
 
2-4 Flight Operations

One of the most important phases of an AIRSAR campaign is the day to day flight operations when the AIRSAR data are acquired. For any given day a strawman flight plan is defined by the AIRSAR Experiment Scientist and passed on to the Ames navigators about two days before the actual flight is scheduled to take place. This lead time allows the navigators to generate an official flight plan and to file it with the relevant authorities for approval. In some cases, such as on deployments away from Moffett Field (and especially on deployments in foreign countries) flight plans must be filed well in advance of the actual flight date and last minute changes are not possible.

## [What is the Deep space Network?](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/somd/space-communications-navigation-program/what-is-the-deep-space-network/) 
The Deep Space Network – or DSN – is NASA’s international array of giant radio antennas that supports interplanetary spacecraft missions, plus a few that orbit Earth. The DSN also provides radar and radio astronomy observations that improve our understanding of the solar system and the larger universe.

The DSN is operated by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which also operates many of the agency’s interplanetary robotic space missions.
The DSN consists of three facilities spaced equidistant from each other – approximately 120 degrees apart in longitude – around the world. These sites are at Goldstone, near Barstow, California; near Madrid, Spain; and near Canberra, Australia. The strategic placement of these sites permits constant communication with spacecraft as our planet rotates – before a distant spacecraft sinks below the horizon at one DSN site, another site can pick up the signal and carry on communicating.

 [Welcome to NASA Earth Observations (NEO)](https://neo.gsfc.nasa.gov/)

 One of the best places to study Earth is from space. NASA satellites continually orbit the globe, collecting information about Earth’s ocean, atmosphere, and land surfaces. Satellites can even monitor the activity of life forms, such as phytoplankton, from their remote vantage points. Satellite imagery provides the greatest benefit to the most people when it can be analyzed by anyone with an interest. NEO strives to make global satellite imagery as accessible as possible.

### [What is CERES?](https://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/)
Climate is controlled by the amount of sunlight absorbed by Earth and the amount of infrared energy emitted to space. These quantities–together with their difference–define Earth’s radiation budget (ERB). [Get_Environment_Data](https://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/data/)

About Us

The ASTER Project consists of two parts, each having a Japanese and a U.S. component. Mission operations are split between Japan Space Systems (J-spacesystems) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in the U.S. J-spacesystems oversees monitoring instrument performance and health, developing the daily schedule command sequence, processing Level 0 data to Level 1, and providing higher level data processing, archiving, and distribution. The JPL ASTER project provides scheduling support for U.S. investigators, calibration and validation of the instrument and data products, coordinating the U.S. Science Team, and maintaining the science algorithms. The joint Japan/U.S. ASTER Science Team has about 40 scientists and researchers. The "Team" link at the left leads to an organizational chart for the U.S. effort. Information about Japan Science Team members may be found on the Japanese ASTER Science Project web page at J-spacesystems.
