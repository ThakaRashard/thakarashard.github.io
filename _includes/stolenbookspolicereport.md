We are Fine Free!
All past, present, and future late fees have been eliminated. Weâ€™re excited to remove this barrier to enjoying library services.

Loss or damage to library materials will still be assessed. Items that are not returned within 28 days of the due date will be considered lost and the customer will be billed the full replacement cost of the item. Customers can avoid this charge by returning library items on time.
