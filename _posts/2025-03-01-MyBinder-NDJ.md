>Jim Taylor, Dennis K. Lee, and Shervin Shambayati 
## 6.1 Mission Overview
The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) [1, 2] has a suite of instruments
making observations at Mars, and it provides data-relay services for Mars
landers and rovers. MRO was launched on August 12, 2005. The orbiter
successfully went into orbit around Mars on March 10, 2006 and began
reducing its orbit altitude and circularizing the orbit in preparation for the
science mission. The orbit changing was accomplished through a process called

aerobraking, in preparation for the “science mission” starting in November
2006, followed by the “relay mission” starting in November 2008. MRO
participated in the Mars Science Laboratory touchdown and surface mission
that began in August 2012 (Chapter 7).

NASAfacts 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration
Falcon 9 Crew Dragon 
Launch Weather Criteria
Do not launch if the sustained wind 
at the 162-foot level of the launch 
pad exceeds 30 mph.
Do not launch through upper-level 
conditions containing wind shear 
that could lead to control problems 
for the launch vehicle.
Do not launch for 30 minutes 
after lightning is observed within 
10 nautical miles of the launch pad 
or the flight path, unless specified 
conditions can be met.
Do not launch within 10 nautical 
miles of an attached thunderstorm 
anvil cloud, unless temperature and 
time-associated distance criteria can 
be met.
Do not launch within 10 nautical 
miles of a detached thunderstorm 
anvil cloud.
Do not launch within 3 nautical 
miles of a thunderstorm debris 
cloud, unless specific time-
associated distance criteria can 
be met.
Do not launch within 5 nautical 
miles of disturbed weather 
clouds that extend into freezing 
temperatures and contain moderate 
or greater precipitation, unless 
specific time-associated distance 
criteria can be met.
Do not launch for 15 minutes if 
field mill instrument readings within 
five nautical miles of the launch pad 
exceed +/- 1,500 volts per meter, or 
+/- 1,000 volts per meter if specified 
criteria can be met.
Do not launch through a cloud 
layer greater than 4,500 feet 
thick that extends into freezing 
temperatures, unless other specific 
criteria can be met.
Do not launch within 10 nautical 
miles of cumulus clouds with 
tops that extend into freezing 
temperatures, unless specific 
height-associated distance criteria 
can be met.
Do not launch within 10 nautical 
miles of the edge of a thunderstorm 
that is producing lightning within 
30 minutes after the last lightning is 
observed.
Do not launch through cumulus 
clouds formed as the result of or 
directly attached to a smoke plume, 
unless time-associated criteria can 
be met.
Do not launch if downrange 
weather indicates violation of limits 
at splashdown in case of Dragon 
launch escape.
Do not launch if downrange 
weather shows high probability of 
violating limits at splashdown in 
case of Dragon launch escape. 
Downrange weather is monitored 
at more than 50 locations along 
the ascent track along the North 
American eastern seaboard and 
across the North Atlantic.
Probability of violation is calculated 
for each location including limit 
conditions for wind, waves, lightning, 

and precipitation.

# DefiningThug
Latrice, I hope you understand that your image of thuggery does not include striptease... I dont think these guys ever promoted that pasttime even if they have been. And All #BlackHeteromen have had at least one significant other kidnapped in thier life by the time they have a child in middle school... In other words, I know how some of the other girls critisized me about working. Erika was a huge critic! But from your perspective you go out and about in your Ohio Neighborhood and you are judign time spent outside and how pleasant your interactions are with their dependents so your definition might stick if you take me to meet them with your mom

Deaths Direct/Indirect	12/0 (fatality details below, when available...)
[link - MALIBU COAST](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=1230300)
Episode Narrative	The combination of very strong Santa Ana winds, mountain wave activity and critically dry vegetation resulted in a significant outbreak of wildfires across Los Angeles and Ventura counties. The Palisades Fire (23,707 acres) and the Eaton Fire (14,021 acres) combined to become the most significant natural disaster in U.S. history. Two smaller fires, the Hurst Fire (799 acres) and the Kenneth Fire (1,052 acres) also developed during this outbreak, but were not anywhere as damaging.
Event Narrative	The Palisades Fire burned 23,707 acres across the Santa Monica Mountains and the Malibu coastal strip. The wildfire ignited during an extreme fire weather event with PDS Red Flag Warnings in effect. The combination of wind gusts in excess of 80 MPH and critically dry vegetation allowed the fire to grow explosively. The fire completed destroyed the community of Pacific Palisades and part of the community of Malibu. Throughout the fire, 6,837 structures were destroyed and another 973 structures were damaged, including many residences. Twelve civilian deaths, three civilian injuries and one firefighter injury were reported.sni
