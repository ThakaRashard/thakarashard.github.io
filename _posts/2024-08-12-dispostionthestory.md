Hi Im still learning how to structure letters! I am Rashard Kelly as my documentation i was given at what i was called my age of responsibility in Savannah Georgia. I married a girl in Alameda named Erika Johnson. We made the connection online on a site called [JWmatch.com](https://www.jwmatch.com/s/a/13906/us_s?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwyo60BhBiEiwAHmVLJUVKuEcZDx6T8rSSxErIqFZ48o8DAe9ve0zpmxxsOoUJX0Z3i1B6thoCRukQAvD_BwE). A man named Marvin Radovitch was a Jehovahs Witness and got [disfellowshipped](https://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/disfellowship-shunning.php) in [Savannah Georgia](https://savannahga.gov/). He was bored and started making friends on [AOL](https://www.wired.com/1999/10/aoldata/) and wanted me to have friends. I was good with girls, but there is a [mob that playboy runss](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/leader-las-vegas-playboy-bloods-street-gang-sentenced-23-years-prison) that captured all my girlfriends and like we paired but there was all this legal much in Jehovahs witnesses about Sexual Contact so my handler Willie Kelly Jr would not let me go off the street. And my Ibeji twin was abducted and raped according to the story she gave me. 
 <a href="https://static.projectmanagement.com/images/profile-photos/46666245_120718014114_p.jpg"><img src="https://static.projectmanagement.com/images/profile-photos/46666245_120718014114_p.jpg" style="width:180px;height:252px;margin-right:5px;padding:10px;" align="left" alt="Pineapple" /> 

She plays [OverWatch](https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/) and does not talk much but she is a singer now, thats how playboy control thier image. She is not in Rabbit Ears in [ThisVideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuNx-_dqM90) but other girls are. I could not listen to the Jehovhas witnesses sexually bc the girls i was in field service with or Hospitality when my "Daddy" gave talks started breaking into my East Atlanta [CraftsmanBungalow](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/631-Moreland-Ave-SE-Atlanta-GA-30316/35832458_zpid/)
![631Moreland](https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e4047d7d1fcfcca0f0a8b0be2c694f27-cc_ft_768.webp) I was renting it from [Renters Warehouse](https://www.renterswarehouse.com/)
, Then my life started falling apart, they were having sex with me, I thought I was dreaming, then thier porno friends and dance ppl from hollywood started being mean to me... 
<a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1711903655501438976/EHEDOh4s_400x400.jpg"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1711903655501438976/EHEDOh4s_400x400.jpg" style="width:180px;height:180px;margin-left:5px;padding:10px;" align="right" alt="Pineapple" /> </a>
[MoreLater](https://thakarashard.github.io/ricothaka/twitters.html) This was after i left [The San Gabriel Valley](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/San_Gabriel_Valley)!

I was working for [NasaJPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/social) and caring for a small child. I know people from [Santa Anita Park](https://parks.lacounty.gov/arcadia-community-regional-park/) remember me palying with her everyday after work. Her mom started a sexual relationship at some point in the tiemline that I did not know about! We were driving a red mustang. I remember some guys in a Blue Grand MArquis rolled up on us in Van Nuys. Erika said i should quit working for a while and Grow. This was after a woman i thought was my mother died! Erika was never nice to me. She is family and I would never hurt her. She ran away when I hit her back. She was abusive bc after [Jehovahs Witnesses fell apart she felt stuck. ](https://x.com/Essence/status/1248047995804884992). I have no problem with her relationship status, but it left me crippled fiscally and immobile, i was 3 weeks late on my car payment and her boyfriend stole my honda fit. I had to let the mustang go for a Title loan bc the car was getting poisoned and i could not afford to commute in it. At least i would have the warranty with the new car. I had no carpayment b4. I get fired as soon as i get comfortable. Since i have a past with NAsa its hard to get work bc im not into porn. But I was advised that I was [Mars Mission Staff](https://github.com/nasa)! The people at the library are stingy with Computer time but the military is doing a silent workforce healing because we can be tracked via [GitHub](https://www.github.careers/careers-home)

If im working on Github and creating usable code im healthy with my employer. I have a contractor issue. Mori's Jose M Pi told me that I could not come back to the Military Base because I was late too often. Our Extended Stay room was getting poisoned and I was taking care of my child fulltime and had worked things out with the mission. I put her in a holistic daycare in Altedena with ponys and had a schedule to make sure she played outside. I have workedd Development Opeerations(Devops) most of my life and a computer is like your radio. Im isolated ive always depended on my employer for a steady connection to the internet, and my life organically grew around it. [Read about my victimization](https://thakarashard.github.io/ricothaka/worknotes#Mori) and bullying by the world of Criminal sex and striptease after I took a year off. No one ever belived I worked! And im always kicked off of social media and no one will talk to me. I think the lady in this video who is [removing my child](https://www.facebook.com/CaptainOfJoy/videos/1826699194158396) is a local sex slave. She is my friend at the very least. Here is the [DekalbCounty Court](https://www.facebook.com/CaptainOfJoy/videos/1826699224158393) removing my child with no notice! I was tossed in the Mental hospital about 3 months later. I was made homeless in stages! Im sacred and need help! [here is some of the story i compiled for Arcadia Police](https://thakarashard.github.io/compiling/Update-Arcadia-Police). Im getting wordy but The girl that took my child, i think it's [Normani](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/normani-cancels-bet-awards-performance-injury_n_6682d314e4b038babc7c6b01). I dont know to what extent but im intimate with her. Erika left me... And Normani has been life coaching me in certain areas. I signed a contract with her under the name Dyneesha... She goes by Kashdoll sometimes and keeps a check on my libraries and other things she getpoints for. Kinda like you guys and speeding tickets [Mashonga](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1826797320815250&set=pb.100004549987965.-2207520000&type=3)
