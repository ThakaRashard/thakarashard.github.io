# This is Rashard Kelly! My new name is Thaka
I was living inside ExtendedStay and i started getting poisoned! I was working for [NASAJPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) and commuting to the facility, i was working with [Mori and Asscociates](https://moriassociates.com/) as a contractor. When i intervied i scored a Unix Admin Level 5 spot! Jamie Mantel said `you are on the mission!` but he said it would take me some time to score a red badge an the contractor badge might run out. I did not get it then, but now i understand that my [Us Draft agreement](https://www.sss.gov/) binds me to working there! And this is the thing. if you were working back then, you would remember me an my little girl Coral at Arcadia Park

# ##RESUME##
This is Rashard's Resume
## My_preferred_name_is: Thaka!

# Current Status

While coronavirus quarantine shut down Georgia's government a sex party started among millenials. There was a populaton within the cult known as Jehovahs witnesses that wated to leave thier spouses they committed to in the org. I am a father of one child i know for sure! And her mother wanted in on the sex party and abandoned me leaving me with the child. She is now 10years old and has been spotted in #SouthernCalifornia her name is coral. The Sexparty people systematically fiscally diabled me and i eventually lost my daughter, i dont know where she is. A artist from my old world in georgia "Glorilla" twitter feed showed her holding two guns, a pistl and an assault rifle. While i am in need im mostly sufering from exclusion because i lost my family. There were a couple women who tried to step in but they work for playboy magazine and got publically humiliated for wanting to start a family with an abandoned man. I have no income. I have been robbed #ransomware i am not mentally disabled. I can do pickup work for cash or join a team for a misson that is complimentary to the United States Space Program. I am on the Mars Mission. A unix administrator. If your family is kidnapped and there are no acces to communications resorces Social Engineering makes it nearly impossible to communictae to meet ones needs. There are rumors of sexual scandal at some of my prior employers that effect my ability to interact with the world to get my needs met. I was diagenosed with Bipolar and Schizophrenia but no one will talk to me abt how my wife's lover used radio for electronic harasment and she was two timing me with a lethal criminal in our area! I am innocent, honest and hardworking I have no way to contact people except through real life meetups coordinated by NasaJPL in Pasadena #Seeking_Paid_Employment
